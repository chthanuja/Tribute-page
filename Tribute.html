        <center><h1>Here's the Biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan</h1></center><br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887,in Erode,Tamil Nadu,India,into a Brahmin family.His father,Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar,worked as a clerk in a sari shop and his mother was Komalatammal.</li><br>

        <li>In 1892,Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.Just before turning 10,in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English,Tamil,geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.That year,He entered Town Higher Secondary School,where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.</li><br>

        <li>In 1903,Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics,G.S.Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems.Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book,The next year,he independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places.</li><br>

        <li>On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki.</li><br>

        <li>In 1910,after a meeting between Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society,V. Ramaswamy Aiyer,Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's mathematical circles, leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras.</li><br>

        <li> He published the first of his papers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society in 1911.His understanding of mathematics and his genius slowly gained recognition.</li><br>

        <li>In 1912,he got a temporary job in the Madras Accountant General's office,where his colleague encouraged him to reach out to G.H. Hardy, who was a famous mathematician at Cambridge University.He led to a special scholarship from the University of Madras and a grant from Trinity College,Cambridge.</li><br>

        <li>In 1914,he traveled to England despite religious objections.Here,Hardy taught him and collaborated with him on some research.Ramanujan,in England also made advances mainly in the partition of numbers.His papers were published in English and European journals.</li><br>

        <li>In 1916,Ramanujan was awarded a Bachelor of Arts by Research degree for his work on highly composite numbers.</li><br>

        <li>On 6 December 1917,Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.</li><br>

        <li>On 2 May 1918, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.</li><br>

        <li>He compiled around 3900 results that consist of equations and identities.One of his most famous findings was his infinite series for pi.</li><br>

        <li>He discovered various new ideas for solving several challenging mathematical problems.He also described the mock theta function.</li><br>

        <li>His several other works include the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, the hypergeometric series, the functional equations of the zeta function, and his own theory of divergent series.</li><br>

        <li><b>Ramanujan Number:</b>'1729' is said to be a magic number.GH Hardy once went to meet Ramanujan at a hospital.He told him that the taxi number was '1729' from which he came but it seemed to be an ordinary number. Ramanujan said that it was not an ordinary number. The genius mathematician said that it is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two different cubes in 2 different ways.</li><br>

        <li>In 1920,he died at the age of 32 after contracting tuberculosis.</li><br>
